If the supplied image is not square or does not match the given width and height, your function should abort with a precondition failure [ref1].\n\nTo implement the `rotate` function, you'll need to consider how to rotate each pixel in the original image and place it in the correct position in the new image. You may want to think about how to calculate the new coordinates for each pixel after rotation.\n\nIf you're still unsure, I recommend reviewing the course materials, especially the section on image manipulation [ref2]. You can also try looking at the `README.txt` file for guidance on how to compile and run your code [ref2].\n\nIf you have any more specific questions about the implementation, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!",

The x-axis becomes the y-axis, and the y-axis becomes the negative x-axis.\n2. **Original coordinates**: For a given pixel at position `(x, y)` in the original image, you need to calculate its new position `(x', y')` in the rotated image.\n3. **Rotation formula**: You can use the following rotation formula to calculate the new coordinates:\n\n`x' = y`\n`y' = -x`\n\nThis formula assumes a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. You can adjust it accordingly for other rotation angles.\n\nFor example, if you have a pixel at position `(3, 4)` in the original image, its new position in the rotated image would be `(4, -3)`.\n\n**Important note**: When rotating the image, you need to consider the center of rotation, which is usually the center of the image. You might need to adjust the coordinates accordingly to ensure that the rotation is correct.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided course materials don't explicitly explain how to calculate the new coordinates for each pixel after rotation. However, I recommend reviewing the section on image manipulation [ref5] and the `README.txt` file for guidance on how to compile and run your code [ref2]. You can also try searching for online resources that explain image rotation and coordinate transformations.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
