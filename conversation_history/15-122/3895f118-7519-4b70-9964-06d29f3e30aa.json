    "content": "I'd be happy to help you understand Bloom filters.\n\nA Bloom filter is a data structure that implements a set interface, as mentioned in [ref3]. It's a probabilistic data structure that can tell you whether an element is a member of a set or not. The interesting twist is that the `bloom_contains` function may lie, meaning it can return a false positive (i.e., it says an element is in the set when it's not), but it will never return a false negative (i.e., it says an element is not in the set when it actually is).\n\nIn other words, a Bloom filter can answer the question \"Is x in the set?\" with either \"no\" or \"maybe\". This is because the filter uses hash functions to map elements to a bit array, and collisions can occur. However, the probability of false positives can be controlled by adjusting the number of hash functions and the size of the bit array.\n\nIn the context of this course, we have a generic Bloom maker interface (see [ref2]) that allows us to create a Bloom filter with a given capacity, add hash functions to it, and freeze it when we're done building it. Once frozen, we can use the Bloom filter to check for membership using the `bloom_contains` function.\n\nThere are also specialized Bloom filter interfaces for specific element types, such as strings (see [ref4]) and meetings (not shown).\n\nIf you'd like to know more about the implementation details of Bloom filters, I recommend checking out the lecture notes or the course textbook. The implementation of Bloom filters in this course uses a struct with a Boolean table, a list of hash functions, and a flag to indicate whether the filter is frozen or not (see [ref5]).\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
