It's a space-efficient way to store a large number of elements and quickly determine whether an element is present or not.\n\nHere's how it works: a Bloom filter consists of a bit array and multiple hash functions. When an element is added to the filter, it's hashed using each of the hash functions, and the resulting indices in the bit array are set to 1. When you want to check if an element is in the filter, you hash it using the same hash functions and check if all the corresponding bits in the array are set to 1. If they are, it's likely that the element is in the filter (but there's a chance of false positives). If any of the bits are 0, you can be certain that the element is not in the filter.\n\nIn the context of this course, we're using a Bloom maker library to create and manage Bloom filters. The library provides functions to create a new Bloom maker, add hash functions to it, freeze the Bloom maker, and then use it as a generic Bloom filter. The `bloommaker_addhash` function adds a hash function to a Bloom maker, and `bloommaker_freeze` freezes the Bloom maker so that no more hash functions can be added [ref2]. Once the Bloom maker is frozen, you can use it to check if an element is in the filter using `bloommaker_contains`, or add an element to the filter using `bloommaker_add` [ref1].\n\nOne important thing to note is that Bloom filters can return false positives, but never false negatives. This means that if the filter says an element is not in the set, you can be certain that it's not, but if it says an element is in the set, there's a chance it's actually not [ref3].\n\nIf you're still unclear about how Bloom filters work, I recommend checking out the course notes or searching online for more resources. There are many great explanations and visualizations out there that can help make the concept more concrete!",
