    "content": "I'd be happy to explain how Bloom filters work.\n\nA Bloom filter is a data structure that implements a set interface, as mentioned in [ref3]. It's a space-efficient way to test whether an element is a member of a set. The interesting twist is that the `bloom_contains` function may lie, which means it can return false positives but never false negatives. In other words, if the Bloom filter says an element is in the set, it might be wrong, but if it says it's not in the set, it's always right.\n\nHere's how it works: when you add an element to a Bloom filter, it uses multiple hash functions to map the element to different indices in a bit array. When you query the Bloom filter to check if an element is in the set, it uses the same hash functions to check the corresponding indices in the bit array. If all the indices are set, it returns true, indicating that the element might be in the set. If any of the indices are not set, it returns false, indicating that the element is definitely not in the set.\n\nThe Bloom maker library, as described in [ref4], provides a way to create and use Bloom filters. You can create a Bloom maker with a given capacity, add hash functions to it, and then freeze it to use it as a generic Bloom filter. The `bloommaker_contains` and `bloommaker_add` functions implement the `bloom_contains` and `bloom_add` functions on a frozen Bloom maker.\n\nFor more information on how Bloom filters work, I recommend checking out the course notes or other online resources. The provided context doesn't dive deeper into the implementation details, but I hope this gives you a good overview of the concept!",
